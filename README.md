- Hi, I’m Kayla
- I’m currently learning SQL and Python in college, and learning Tableau and PowerBI with LinkedIn Learning.
- I am graduating with my BS in IT, minor in Data Analytics in September 2022. 
- I am looking for an entry level data analyst or HR analyst job to supplement my education and begin getting real world experience in data. 
- I have over five years of human resource experience, 
- and I have right at three years of reporting and analysis experience taking raw data and organizing it into readable reports and charts/tables in MS Excel. 
- I am excited to officially get into the data field and begin making a difference for a company with great benefits and an incredible culture so we can equally benefit each other.
